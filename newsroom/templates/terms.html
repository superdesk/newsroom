                        A Subscriber is eligible to receive points when purchasing images designated as Editorial, Premium “Non-Royalty-Free Images” and “Royalty-Free Images” at www.cpimages.com. Points will not be awarded to a Subscriber for other purchases or acquisitions made at www.cpimages.com including but not limited to the purchase or acquisition of images designated as “Publicity Images”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, points will not be awarded to a Subscriber in relation to any image that is also available to the Subscriber as a member of The Canadian Press pursuant to a member news agreement or a member picture agreement. Further, points will not be awarded to a Subscriber in relation to any image that is also available to the Subscriber pursuant to an agreement wherein the Subscriber is entitled to make certain use of such image in exchange for the Subscriber’s payment of a monthly fee or a fee pursuant to some other payment schedule. There is no limit on the amount of Royalty-Free Images and Non Royalty Free Images a Subscriber can purchase and there is no limit to the amount of points a Subscriber can accumulate in its account. All purchases must be made with the Subscriber’s account in order to receive points. Points will be automatically posted to the Subscriber’s account following a purchase. All points will be credited to the Subscriber’s account and no other person or company except Subscriber may earn points for a purchase by the Subscriber.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        When a Subscriber purchases a Non-Royalty-Free Images or Royalty-Free Image from www.cpimages.com, 5% of the purchase price, not including tax, is “banked” in the Subscriber’s account as rewards points on the basis that one point is equal to one Canadian dollar. For example, if a Subscriber purchases an eligible Image for $100 then the Subscriber’s account will be awarded 5 reward points.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minimum requirement points: Subscribers must have accrued a minimum of 50 points + 4 points for the AEIS Transaction Fee (as set out below) for a total of 54 points in order to redeem the Subscriber’s points for an AEIS Card valued at 50 points or CDN$50 dollars.

The AEIS Transaction Fee will be added on each transaction. (The AEIS Transaction Fee can be changed at any time.)

                        At redemption time, The Canadian Press will send an order to AEIS for fulfillment. AEIS will load an AEIS Card with points and deliver the card to the Subscriber. The Subscriber acknowledges that any AEIS Card acquired through the Program must be used prior to the valid thru date on the AEIS Card and are no longer redeemable after the last day of the month that is embossed on the AEIS Card face. No refund will be made with respect to points remaining on cards after such date. Once an AEIS Card is issued or given to a Subscriber, an agreement between AEIS and the Subscriber exists and is so documented in terms that accompany each card (the “Participant Agreement”). AEIS may change the terms of the Participant Agreement at its sole discretion and without notice to you.

Immediately upon delivery to the address provided by you, the full risk of loss for AEIS Cards ordered shall pass to the Subscriber.
