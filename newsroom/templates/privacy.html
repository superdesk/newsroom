                    <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p class="mb-5">On January 1, 2004, a three-year phase-in of Canada’s sweeping privacy legislation ended, and application of the legislation was extended beyond the federally regulated private sector to most organizations in Canada.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) dramatically modernizes Canada’s privacy laws and may require changes in how organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information about individuals in the course of commercial activities, whether day-to-day operations or in a significant transaction.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5"><em>“Personal information” includes</em> any factual or subjective information, recorded or not, about an identifiable individual. This includes information in any form such as: age, ID numbers, income, ethnic origins, or blood type; opinions, evaluations, comments, social status or disciplinary actions; employee files, credit records, loan records, medical records, existence of a dispute between a consumer and a merchant, intentions (for example, to acquire goods or services, or change jobs).</p>
                    <p class="mb-5"><em>“Personal Information” does not include</em> the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">News Media Canada respects your privacy and does everything in its power to protect the confidentiality of any personal information you may give us. We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings. News Media Canada only collects personal information with the knowledge of the individual involved.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">We will explain what information is being collected and how it will be used. You have the right to decline to have this information collected or transferred. We will not disclose any personal information about users to any outside parties unless the user was advised of this possibility before providing the personal information. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">You may provide us with information online, in a telephone conversation, or through a completed printed form. The information you provide will be securely stored either on a computer or as part of a hard-copy filing system. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time by updating this posting. If you are under 18, be sure to obtain your parent/guardian's permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">There are links on the News Media Canada website that take you to other websites outside of our service. Any links provided to third-party websites are provided solely for your convenience.
